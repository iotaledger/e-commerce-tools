## Introduction

IOTA Integration Services is a [Node](https://nodejs.org/) microservice responsible to simplify access to decentralized digital identity, 
also known as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Streams techonology on the IOTA tangle. 

> **WARNING** 
>
> This library is currently  **under development** and might undergo large changes!
> Until a formal third-party security audit has taken place, the [IOTA Foundation](https://www.iota.org/) makes no guarantees to the fitness of this library. 
> As such, it is to be seen as **experimental** and not ready for real-world applications.
> Nevertheless, we are very interested in feedback about user experience, design and implementation, and encourage you to reach out with any concerns or suggestions you may have.
