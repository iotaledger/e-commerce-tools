# Ecommerce-Audit Trail Bridge

The Ecommerce-Audit Trail Bridge allows users to create immutable data channels and share them with others. By requesting a subscription to a channel a so called subscriber can request `Read`, `Write`, `ReadAndWrite` access to the channel. This request must then be authorized by the creator (author) of the channel. After a subscriber is authorized, he is then able to write/read to/from the channel. 

## Ecommerce-Audit Trail Bridge APIs Definition

The list of provided APIs is shown in figure below. Endpoints which are currently not available are marked in grey. 
> The api currently allows only one subscriber to a channel which is able to read and write from/to the channel. Also the author is able to read and write from/to the channel.

1. Authenticate at API
2. Create channel (this user becomes the author)
3. Subscribe to channel as different user (this user becomes the subscriber)
4. Authorize subscription to channel as author
5. Subscriber writes to channel
6. Author reads from channel
7. Author writes to channel
8. Subscriber reads from channel
