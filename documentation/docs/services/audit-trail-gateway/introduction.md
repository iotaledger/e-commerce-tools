# Ecommerce-Audit Trail Gateway (GW)

The Ecommerce-Audit Trail Gateway allows you to create and share immutable data channels and store the channel’s data on
the IOTA Tangle. A channel is implemented as an IOTA Stream and can handle multiple different types of **Subscribers**.
When you request `Read`, `Write`or `ReadAndWrite` access to a channel, you become a channel Subscriber. However, it is
up to the channel’s creator (**Author**) to authorize these requests. In addition to authorized subscribers, the author
can always read and write messages in the channel.

:::caution Important 

The Audit Trail GW currently integrates the [SSI Bridge](../SSI-bridge/introduction.md)
to identify and authorize subscribers. This means anyone interacting with the audit trail must create their
own [Identity](../../basics/identity.md) beforehand.

In the future, you will be able to remove this dependency and deploy the Audit Trail and Gateway in the presence of
other (centralized) Accounting, Authentication, and Authorization (AAA) systems.

The figure below shows a logic architecture with the integration of both IOTA Integration Services.
