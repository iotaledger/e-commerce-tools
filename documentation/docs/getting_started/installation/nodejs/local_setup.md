# Local Setup

This section will guide in setting up the Integration Service API using Node.js. It is mainly relevant for developers who want to contribute to the project or create a project fork.

## Requirements

Please make sure to have the following installed before moving forward:

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Download the Project

1. Clone the project by running the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/integration-services.git
    ```

2. Change directory into the `api` folder in your freshly cloned project by running:

    ```bash
    cd integration-services/api
    ```

## Configure Env Vars

If this is your first time installing the project, please make a copy of
the [.env.example file](https://github.com/iotaledger/integration-services/blob/master/api/.env.example) and rename it
as `.env`, and also copy the [mongo-init.js.example](https://github.com/iotaledger/integration-services/blob/master/api/mongo-init.js.example) and rename it as `mongo.init.js`.

After you have done this, replace `db-user`, `db-password`, `dn-name`, `server-secret` and `optional-api-key` in the
newly created `.env` and `mongo-init.js` files accordingly.

:::danger
Important The `server-secret` must be 32 characters length
:::

:::tip 

You can create a server secret using the following commands:
```
cd ssi-bridge
npm run generate-secret
cd ..
```

:::

Here is an example of how a `.env` file should look like:

````dotenv
PORT=3000
IOTA_PERMA_NODE=https://chrysalis-chronicle.iota.org/api/mainnet/
IOTA_HORNET_NODE=https://chrysalis-nodes.iota.org:443

DATABASE_NAME=integration-services
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://root:rootpassword@0.0.0.0:27017

SERVER_SECRET=7w9gfhb123jngh4gd53z465fewcs569e
JWT_SECRET=7w9gfhb123jngh4gd53z465fewcs569e

API_KEY=4ed59704-9a26-11ec-a749-3f57454709b9
````

Here is an example of how a corresponding `mongo-init.js` file should look like:

```javascript
db.createUser(
    {
        user: "root",
        pwd: "rootpassword",
        roles: [
            {
                role: "readWrite",
                db: "integration-services"
            }
        ]
    }
);
```

:::note
Make sure that you use the same value for the same variables inside `.env` and `mongo-init.js`
:::


## Configure Audit-Trail Gateway & SSI-Bridge

Add the same `.env` configuration as above to the subfolders of the `ssi-bridge` and `audit-trail-gw`.

The folder structure should look like the following:
```
| api
|- mongo-init.js
|- .env
|- ...
|
|- audit-trail-gw
|-- .env
|-- ...
|
|- ssi-bridge
|-- .env
|-- ...
|
```

## Start the Services

### Start the MongoDB

After you have added the `.env` and `mongo-init.js` you can start the mongodb in the root folder of `/api` by running the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d mongo
```

This must only be run once to start the MongoDB you can always check if the MongoDB container is running by running `docker ps` which should generate a similar output as:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS       PORTS                                              NAMES
f15ab2571369   mongo:latest  "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   7 weeks ago    Up 7 weeks   0.0.0.0:27017->27017/tcp, :::27017->27017/tcp      api_mongo_1
```

### Setup Integration Services API

The setup will install all external dependencies and build the services. If you are starting the API for the first time, you should run `setup-api` to set up a root identity for the service and the database. 

#### Setup SSI-Bridge

1. Move into the folder `ssi-bridge`.
2. Adjust the PORT env var of the `.env` file to `PORT=3001`.
3. Run the following commands to install dependencies, build the project, set up the API, and finally start the SSI-Bridge:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run setup-api
npm run start
```

4. You can check if the service is running with the following command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/info
```

#### Set up the Audit-Trail Gateway

1. Move into the folder `audit-trail-gw`.
2. Adjust the PORT env var of the `.env` file to `PORT=3002`.
3.  Run the following commands to install dependencies, build the project, set up the API, and finally start the Audit-Trail Gateway:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run setup-api
npm run start
```

4. You can check if the service is running with the following command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/info
```
