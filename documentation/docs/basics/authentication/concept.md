# Concept

The Integration Services API uses JSON Web Tokens ([JWTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token)) as a secure way to authenticate yourself. First, you must sign a nonce (number only used once) generated by the API with your secret key to obtain a JWT. Afterwards, the API verifies the signed nonce and returns a JWT.

## Authentication Workflow

### 1. Request a Nonce

First, you must request the nonce via a get request to the endpoint. Provide the identity id to authenticate in the URL. You can find more information in the [API Reference](../../services/SSI-bridge/ssi_bridge_api_reference.md)

GET `/authentication/prove-ownership/<identity-id>`

JSON response body:

```json
{
  "nonce": "748fd25be77773dbce248779e4982b6759f84071"
}
```

### 2. Hash the Nonce

Once you have received your nonce, you should hash it using [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) and encode it to hexadecimal to sign it afterwards.

### 3. Sign the Hashed Nonce

You can now sign the hashed nonce with your secret key. Your secret key is encoded in Base58 and needs to be decoded to hexadecimal.
You can sign your hashed nonce with your decoded secret key using the [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519) algorithm. Make sure that the signed nonce is in hexadecimal.

### 4. Request the JWT

You can request your JWT using the `/authentication/prove-ownership/<identity-id>` endpoint. It is the same endpoint as in the first step, but it uses the POST method instead of GET. You should add your signed nonce in the request body. You can find more information in the [API Reference](../../services/SSI-bridge/ssi_bridge_api_reference.md).

POST `/authentication/prove-ownership/<identity-id>`

JSON request body:

```json
{
  "signedNonce": "9606885340235e37d43..."
}
```

JSON response body:

```json
{
  "jwt": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI..."
}
```

### 5. Use the JWT in a Header

For all following requests to endpoints protected by authentication use your JWT in the `Authentication` header with the prefix Bearer: `Authentication: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...`

## Examples

We provide examples of this workflow in the following languages:

1. [Node](example_node.md)
2. [Iota-is-sdk (Node client)](example_is_sdk.md)
