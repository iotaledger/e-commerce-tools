# IOTA Identity

IOTA Identity provides a digital identity anchored on the Tangle and verifiable credentials (VC) 
that are attachable to said identity. For example, a university student could use this to [validate his degree](https://wiki.iota.org/identity.rs/tutorials/validate_university_degree), or it could be applied in combination with [IOTA Streams](streams.md) to validate a patient's prescriptions and medical data as illustrated bellow.

The concepts of decentralized identities will not be explained in depth in this wiki. You can find more information on IOTA Identity in the following resources:
