# Create Identity and Credentials

The [example-1](https://github.com/iotaledger/integration-services/blob/master/clients/node/examples/1-CreateIdentityAndCredential.ts)
script authenticates an Integration Service client to manage Identities using the Admin identity
created in [example-0](./how-to-run-examples) and then performs the following tasks:

1. Creates a new Identity (`userIdentity`).
2. Creates a credential for that identity (`userCredential`).
3. Verifies the generated credential (`await identity.checkCredential(userCredential)`).

You can run the example with the following command:

```bash
npm run example-1
```

## Authentication

You can use the following script to authenticate the client using the Admin identity and get the
BasicIdentityCredential that the admin owns: this VC (verifiable credential),
which is required for an Issuer to sign verifiable credentials for other Identities.

```js
import { IdentityClient, IdentityJson } from '@iota/is-client';

...

// Initialize IdentityClient with previously setup parameters
const identity = new IdentityClient({
  ssiBridgeUrl: process.env.SSI_BRIDGE_URL,
  auditTrailUrl: process.env.AUDIT_TRAIL_URL,
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  apiVersion: ApiVersion.v01
});

// Recover the admin identity
const adminIdentity = JSON.parse(readFileSync("./adminIdentity.json").toString()) as IdentityJson;

// Authenticate as the admin identity
await identity.authenticate(adminIdentity.doc.id, adminIdentity.key.secret);

// Get admin identity data
const adminIdentityPublic = await identity.find(adminIdentity.doc.id);

// Get admin identy's VC
const identityCredential = adminIdentityPublic?.verifiableCredentials?.[0];

console.log("Identity Credential of Admin", identityCredential);
```

## Create an Identity

The method `createCredential` requires a valid verifiable credential of type
BasicIdentity, the destination DID the type and the claim, which can be created using the following script.

```js
// Create identity for user
const userIdentity = await identity.create("User-" + Math.ceil(Math.random() * 100000);

console.log("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~");
console.log("Created user identity: ", userIdentity);
console.log("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~");
// Assign a verifiable credential to the user as rootIdentity.
// With the BasicIdentityCredential the user is not allowed to issue further credentials
const userCredential = await identity.createCredential(
  identityCredential,
  userIdentity?.doc?.id,
  CredentialTypes.BasicIdentityCredential,
  UserType.Person,
  {
    profession: "Professor",
  }
);
```

## Verify a Credential

You can verify a credential using the following script:

```js
const verified = await identity.checkCredential(userCredential);

console.log("Verification result: ", verified);
```
